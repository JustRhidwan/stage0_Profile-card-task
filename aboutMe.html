        <h2>My Biography</h2>
        <p>  Computers have always been my thing. As far as I can remember, I wrote my first line of code in high school
            I was just really fascinated and curious about how things worked.
            Over time, that curiosity became something more.
            I'm a passionate web developer with a knack for creating clean, user-friendly websites. I love the challenge
             of turning ideas into reality and seeing them come to life online.</p>
